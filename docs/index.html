<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.</li>
  <li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies with great potential for exploration to be implemented in the future</li>
  <li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies currently undergoing issues and requiring replacement</li>
  <li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used. Technologies that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
Identify best practices in ANZx Cloud Platform - for service owners running workload in clusters on our platform (e.g. managing secrets, what should/shouldn't do). Furthermore, this information can be used for decision making & prioritisation of work.<br/>
</p>

<h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>
